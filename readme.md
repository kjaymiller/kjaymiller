## Status

<p>With the power of PostgreSQL, Python, and claude, I:</p>

<ul>
<li>Transposed some blog analytics by year from our company analytics service (exported to csv)</li>
<li>Uploaded that raw data into Postgres</li>
<li>Created a function that looked at each month and found the top three posts</li>
<li>Moved those results into a temp_table that can use to get more information and do more analysis</li>
</ul>

<p>Genuinely the most helpful AI has been and it still took about 2 hours of feeding the errors back in and explaining what it did wrong... Now I will have it explain each line of that gnarly function to me so I can write a new blog post...</p>
