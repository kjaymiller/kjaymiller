<p><a href="https://mastodon.social/@ehmatthes@fosstodon.org">Eric</a> I don't know if this was intentional but I am often discouraged when I have to write messy exploratory code.</p>

<p>I think it's based on live-coding sessions or coding interviews (I haven't had too many of those) I feel like I have to defend every decision I make or I'm a bad developer.</p>

<p>This has made me try to write the best most performant code possible.</p>

<p>Thank you for reminder that process doesn't have to be pristine and sometimes worrying about the wrong things can make it harder to get things right.</p>
