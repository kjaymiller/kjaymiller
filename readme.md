## Status:
<p>I hope folks in the US remember this #MemorialDay, Since 9/11 - more service members and veterans die by suicide than combat every year.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1009846329/military-suicides-deaths-mental-health-crisis">https://www.npr.org/2021/06/24/1009846329/military-suicides-deaths-mental-health-crisis</a></p>

<p>I'm a veteran and I struggle with depression and PTSD. I lost one of my brothers-in-arms and groomsmen to drug abuse and suicide. There isn't a week that goes by where I don't think of him; today I write this through tears of guilt.</p>

<p>Do the simple thing ask a service-member how they're doing and how is their mental health.</p>
