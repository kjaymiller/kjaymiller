## Status

<p>In conversation with PyTexas Foundation, I was inspired to the accidental capitalism conversation to make this sticker. Should I make an accidental capitalism in making these stickers and selling them on Etsy?</p>

<p>No the answer is always no, but I should make like 20 of these stickers and put them out at conferences.</p>
