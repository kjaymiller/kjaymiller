## Status:
<p>I recently added a <a href="https://github.com/sissbruecker/linkding">linkding</a> container and I'm happy about two things.</p>

<ol>
<li><p>It's django behind the scenes (maybe I can tinker)</p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff/">https://nojack.easydns.ca/@ttscoff/</a> created a <a href="https://brettterpstra.com/2024/11/18/a-card-based-layout-for-linkding/">custom tiling css layout</a>. It looks great!</p></li>
</ol>
