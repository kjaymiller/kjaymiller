## Status:
<p>TIL: I have some plugin in lazyVIM that is listing my code. The downside is I don't know which plugin it is and if it is black then I have a new problem where the linter and running <code>black .</code> are coming up with different results...</p>

<p>What I have yet to learn is how to fix it...</p>
