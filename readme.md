## Status

<p>I made mistakes in my running through the data points in my <a href="https://kjaymiller.com/blog/my-thoughts-on-the-psf-grant-funding-changes.html">last post</a>.</p>

<p>The updated information shows that 4 more events, including one in the US requested over the soon to be capped amount. This brings the total potentially saved from 4% to close to 10%.</p>

<p>I updated the data and apologize for this oversight.</p>
