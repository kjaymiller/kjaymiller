## Status

<p>I'm so dang proud of my leaders!</p>

<p>Thanks to the work from Tim Schilling, Ngazetungue Muheue, and others. We matched our fundraising from last year at DjangoCon US.</p>

<p>I don't think you understand how amazing that is. This year neither myself nor Lazouich Ford (our US Executor) were involved which meant they handled booth stuff, swag, messaging and donations.</p>

<p>This will be more and more important in the next years as we expand leadership and prepare for when our earliest leaders start to step down.</p>

<p>Great work team!</p>
