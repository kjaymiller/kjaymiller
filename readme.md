<p>Ruto refuses to sign the finance bill as is but their Parliament vote was 64% yes. They only need to flip 3-4 people to get a large-enough majority to pass it anyway.</p>

<p>Kenyans, (If it is okay for an American with many Kenyan friends to speak up), keep the pressure on your politicians.</p>

<p>Americans, find some Kenyan folks to learn from and be as loud as you are about your least favorite OLD WHITE DUDE IN CHARGE.</p>
