<p>Been watching it this morning an was instantly reminded that communities out here always need help.</p>

<p>The likely first big help you can do is first and foremost be a friendly welcoming face in the community that works to make everyone who enters feel welcome.</p>

<p>Then it can expand to doing simple tasks with no need of writing code.</p>

<p>So take a look at your local community and see if you can offer a little bit of help.</p>
