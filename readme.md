## Status:
<p>Trying out <a href="https://github.com/folke/zen-mode.nvim">ZenMode</a> and <a href="https://github.com/folke/twilight.nvim">Twilight</a> for my NVIM config. I'm not sure I can tell a difference.</p>

<p>When included with Twilight I think it is pretty nice for writing but I definitely like it with writing code as my eyes tend to wander around code a lot.</p>
