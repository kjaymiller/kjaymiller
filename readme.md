<p>I've been trusting dependabot more and more and nore I'm using Anthony Shaw's (@tonybaloney@fosstodon.org) <a href="https://github.com/tonybaloney/dependabot-bot">Dependabot-bot</a>.</p>

<p>Of course I'm not suggesting that you blindly merge PRs but I'm also being honest that without maintainers, lots of folks are doing this anyway.</p>

<p>Also as a contingency I'm only autoapproving the updates from the main dependencies and not their dependencies.</p>

<p>Also not auto publishing releases and all releases are tested before a publish will go through.</p>
