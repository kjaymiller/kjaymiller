## Status

<p>Did you know that UUIDv7 is also supported by Python 3.14?</p>

<p>I along with my colleague Alexander Fridriksson are diving into some of the new features in #postgres18. We just released our look at UUIDv7.</p>

<p>UUIDv7 is almost a no brainer for new projects, simplifying indexing strategies and giving you a time-based organizing feature across multiple sources.</p>

<p>Stay tuned as there will be more to explore in PostgreSQL 18 and you can try it all out for free on the Aiven Platform.</p>
