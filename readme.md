<p>Responding to Julius' post on <a href="https://medium.com/@theflyboy/breaking-barriers-a-tech-speakers-plea-for-fair-visa-policies-621b5909e496">their challenges with visa policies</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Imagine preparing for months to speak at a prestigious conference or to collaborate on a groundbreaking project abroad, only to have your visa application rejected.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve been following Juliusâ€™ work not just in the BPD community.</p>

<p>Americaâ€™s policies feel greedy. We talk about the expanding the American dream around the world. When people want to come over for a couple weeks to America to share skills and opportunities that make both parties better, we're like but you could give up all your progress in becoming a recognized leader in your own community and country to become an outlaw???</p>

<p>It makes no sense and even when we write letters and do everything we can to show how beneficial it would be to have them with us, it doesn't matter.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, those folks will share their knowledge with those in Europe and (LISTEN UP POLITICIANS) our <em>political adversaries</em> like China. I know this because I'm <strong>already</strong> being asked to write letters of recommendations for people in Africa to learn and share their leadership skills in those areas already.</p>

<p>When we feel like we're being left behind on the global stage, this will be the reason why.</p>
