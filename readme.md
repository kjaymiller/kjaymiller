## Status

<p>Dear PSF:</p>

<p>I feel like "Thank you for your submission" and a pre-canned message from a form response is a better user experience than this.</p>

<p>I definitely don't feel like I want to nominate more individuals from this response.</p>

<p>Maybe a form that you need to log in with your PSF membership account to access or something is a way to validate users.</p>
