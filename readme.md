## Status

<p><a href="https://kjaymiller.com/@PavloGolub@fosstodon.org">@pashagolub</a> has made an interesting tool that uses the Elo system (yes from chess!) to help rate talks (for CFP Selection).</p>

<p>I made a fork of it because I would love to see this modified to fit a double-blind CFPs.</p>

<p>Happy for people to submit a PR on mine as I have some thoughts on how I would want to use this with tools like sessionize or pretalx eventually.</p>

<p>I also am not usually a conference organizer so I'm not the best person to offer much input.</p>
